    "### Incident Wavefield\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume an incident wavefield \\(\\psi_i(x,y)\\), which can have any form, not restricted to plane waves:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\psi_i(x,y) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Transmission Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample is characterized by a transmission function \\(T(x,y)\\), which may include both amplitude and phase modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ T(x,y) = A_T(x,y) e^{i \\phi(x,y)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(A_T(x,y)\\) is the amplitude modulation by the sample.\n",
    "- \\(\\phi(x,y)\\) is the phase shift introduced by the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modified Wavefield After Interaction with the Sample\n",
    "\n",
    "When the incident wavefield \\(\\psi_i(x,y)\\) interacts with the sample, the transmitted wavefield \\(\\psi_t(x,y)\\) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\psi_t(x,y) = \\psi_i(x,y) T(x,y) = \\psi_i(x,y) A_T(x,y) e^{i \\phi(x,y)} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scattered Wavefield\n",
    "\n",
    "To describe the scattered wavefield \\(\\psi_s\\) resulting from this interaction, we use the Huygens-Fresnel principle, which states that every point on a wavefront can be considered a source of secondary spherical wavelets. The resultant wavefield is the superposition of these secondary wavelets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Scattering Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "The scattered wavefield \\(\\psi_s(x',y')\\) at a point \\((x',y')\\) can be expressed as an integral over the contributions from each point \\((x,y)\\) in the sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\psi_s(x',y') = \\iint \\frac{\\psi_t(x,y)}{r} e^{ikr} dx dy \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \\(k\\) is the wavenumber.\n",
    "- \\(r\\) is the distance between the point \\((x,y)\\) in the sample and the observation point \\((x',y')\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance \\(r\\) can be approximated in the far-field (Fraunhofer approximation) or near-field (Fresnel approximation) regimes. For a general treatment, we use the exact expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ r = \\sqrt{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2 + z^2} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\(z\\) is the distance along the propagation direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integral Form of the Scattered Field\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the exact form of \\(r\\), the scattered wavefield is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\psi_s(x',y') = \\iint \\frac{\\psi_i(x,y) A_T(x,y) e^{i \\phi(x,y)}}{\\sqrt{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2 + z^2}} e^{ik \\sqrt{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2 + z^2}} dx dy \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simplifying Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical purposes, the exact expression can often be simplified using approximations. If we assume the far-field (Fraunhofer approximation), the phase factor can be linearized, and the distance \\(r\\) can be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ r \\approx z \\left(1 + \\frac{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2}{2z^2}\\right) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "leading to a simplified expression for the scattered wavefield:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\psi_s(x',y') \\approx \\frac{e^{ikz}}{z} \\iint \\psi_i(x,y) A_T(x,y) e^{i \\phi(x,y)} e^{ik \\left( \\frac{(x' - x)^2 + (y' - y)^2}{2z} \\right)} dx dy \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intensity of the Scattered Wavefield\n",
    "\n",
    "The intensity of the scattered wavefield is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ I_s(x',y') = \\left| \\psi_s(x',y') \\right|^2 \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The scattering of a general wavefield \\(\\psi(x,y)\\) from a sample \\(T(x,y)\\) can be described b\n"
